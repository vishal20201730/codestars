            <p>Data Structures and Algorithms are building blocks of programming. Data structures enable us<br> to organise and store data, whereas algorithms enable us to process that data in a meaningful<br> sense. Then, why wait? Opt for a quality DSA Course to build & enhance your data structures and algorithms foundational skills.</p><br>
            <p>This Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) self-paced course that has been divided into 8 weeks<br> of curriculum for your easy learning.<b> Master the basics of DSA, practice coding questions &</b> <br> attempt the assessment tests from anywhere in the world! The questions in this self paced<br> course will further help you to prepare for SDE interviews with top-notch companies like<br> Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe and other top product based companies. </p><br>
            <p>This course does not require any prior knowledge of Data Structure and Algorithms and it covers <br>all topics in two languages: C++ and Java. You will also learn algorithmic techniques for solving <br>various problems, get to learn important topics for interviews and get fluent in the basics of<br> programming. You will master all the important topics of data structures and algorithms like <br>sorting, strings, heaps, DP, searching, trees and more and even learn this concepts by practicing on real-world projects.</p>
